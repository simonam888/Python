#This project is for you to test how fast you can type :)! Below I have attached a small paragraph you can copy in order to test it if you'd like!

#It is debated whether the fourth leaf is caused genetically or environmentally. Its relative rarity (1 in 5,000 clovers)
#suggests a possible recessive gene appearing at a low frequency. Alternatively, four-leaf clovers could be caused by
#somatic mutation or a developmental error of environmental causes. They could also be caused by the interaction of several genes
#that happen to segregate in the individual plant. It is possible all four explanations could apply to individual cases.
#This means that multiple four-leaf clovers could be found in the same cloverplant.
